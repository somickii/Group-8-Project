and also to introduce returning and new students to the amazing Club Members.
With a Home page so Welcoming it is as if it were a mat at the front door, you can find the
Mission Statement along with the Objective and so much more. Have a scroll, you will also be
able to see the current club members as well as the C.H.I.P.S. graduates.
Would you like to meet the members ? Go on over to our navigation bar and hit Club Members

their student experience. The users of this website will be able to post blogs and view the latest blog
post of other users from the homepage. The different types of blog posts that can be posted on this
platform include pictures, videos and text. In the navigation bar, the users will be able to navigate
from the homepage, to the C.H.I.P.S gallery view the contact information and be rerouted to the
C.H.I.P.S website. The Vine platform was created so that past and present students could have an
interactive way for students to communicate with each other and keep up to date with all the different
activities and events that are being held by the C.H.I.P.S. club.
